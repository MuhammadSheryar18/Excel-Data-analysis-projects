This is a Excel end to end Data Analysis Project.
This data analysis project presents a dashboard with visualizations for an ecommerce store. It provides insights on monthly sales and profit analysis, average order value by payment method, profit analysis by categories, order quantity trend over time, and customer acquisition rate. The dashboard allows users to explore these metrics and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales and profitability in the ecommerce store.
By sharing this project, I am aiming to provide a valuable resource for ecommerce businesses, data analysts, and enthusiasts. The insights and visualizations presented in the dashboard can help drive strategic decision-making, improve sales performance, and enhance customer acquisition and retention strategies.
